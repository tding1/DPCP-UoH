% Median K-flats
% [basis d newenergy iter]=kmcl1sd(B,planedimensions,dt,maxiter,initcent)
% partitions the points in the N-by-D matrix B into clusters with dimensions planedimensions.
% Rows of B correspond to points, columns correspond to variables.
% Input:
% B: N-by-D matrix, represents N points on the unit D-1 dimensional sphere of D-dimensional ambient space,
% planedimensions: a vector represents the dimensions of the subspaces. 
% dt: The "step size" for the gradient boosting
% maxiter: the maximal allowed iterations.
% initcent is choice of initialization: if a structure array of matrices,
% is used as the initial subspaces.  if 2, nearest neighbor initialization. Default value is 2.
% is used.  if 0, orthogonalized random normal subspace is used.
% online: if it is 1 then this algorithm is online: stopping rule is obtained from
% checking the subspaces, if it is 0 then it is not online: stopping rule
% is obtained from checking the energy. Default value is 1
% Output:
% basis: a structure with length length(planedimensions), basis{i} is a D by
% planedimensions(i) matrix represents the orthogonal basis of the i-th subspace.
% label: a N-vector represents the classes of each points.
% newenergy: the l1-energy we obtained from this algorithm.
% iter: the number of iterations performed in this algorithm.
